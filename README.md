# 1D wave model

This repository is the 1D wave model written in MATLAB presented in the paper "Insert title". The model captures four different mechanisms that affect wave propagation in the cross-shore direction, including wave breaking, vegetation drag, shoaling, and bed friction. In particular, the vegetation drag is computed based on plant morphology without any use of emprirically calibrated parameters.
